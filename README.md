> ## 🔧 Skill: OpenGrid Under-Desk Accessory Mount Design
>
> ### System Overview
>
> **OpenGrid** (by David D) is a 28mm-grid modular mounting ecosystem. Accessories mount to grid panels via printed **Multiconnect snaps** that clip into grid holes.
>
> **Key URLs:**
> - Main ecosystem: https://makerworld.com/en/models/1179191 (David D)
> - - Multiconnect snaps to print: same page → "OpenGrid Multiconnect" profile
>   - - Tile Generator reference (BlackjackDuck): https://makerworld.com/en/models/1304337
>     - - Snap SCAD spec: https://github.com/AndyLevesque/QuackWorks/blob/main/openGrid/opengrid-snap.scad
>       - - Thread docs PDF: downloadable from David D's page → Documentation section
>        
>         - ---
>
> ### Critical Dimensions (from official spec)
>
> | Property | Value | Source |
> |---|---|---|
> | Grid spacing | 28mm center-to-center | David D / BlackjackDuck confirmed |
> | Snap square size | 24.80 x 24.80mm | opengrid-snap.scad |
> | Snap lite height | 3.4mm | opengrid-snap.scad |
> | Snap full height | 6.8mm | opengrid-snap.scad |
> | MC channel top width | 14.5mm | Multiconnect Thread Docs PDF |
> | MC channel bottom width | 12.9mm | Multiconnect Thread Docs PDF |
> | MC channel depth | 2.2mm | Multiconnect Thread Docs PDF |
> | Flange min thickness | ch_depth + 2mm = 4.2mm | derived |
>
> **Multiconnect channel profile** (female/negative, dovetail slot in top face):
> ```
> top: 14.5mm wide
>                \              /   depth: 2.2mm
> bot: 12.9mm wide
> ```
>
> ---
>
> ### Accessory Design Pattern
>
> Every under-desk OpenGrid accessory follows this pattern:
>
> **1. Mounting Flange** — flat plate pressing against underside of grid panel
> - Contains Multiconnect dovetail channel(s) on its TOP face
> - - Channels spaced every 28mm (grid spacing)
>   - - Flange thickness >= 4.2mm
>     - - Snap slides into channel from side, locks into grid above
>      
>       - **2. Functional Body** — hangs DOWN from the flange, sized to the object
>      
>       - **3. Print snaps separately** — use David D's Multiconnect profile, ~2 per mount point
>      
>       - ---
>
> ### Lessons Learned
>
> - **Don't assume the connector** — look up the official spec first. We lost 2 iterations using a square pocket instead of the correct dovetail profile.
> - - **Check bed size early** — P2S is 256x256mm. Anything wider needs splitting or diagonal orientation.
>   - - **Blind pockets != dovetail channels** — Multiconnect uses a sliding dovetail, not press-fit pockets.
>     - - **Grid is 28mm, not 25mm** — confirm before starting.
>       - - **JavaScript injection into CodeMirror is unreliable** — use Cmd+A + type to replace code in MakerWorld editor.
>         - - **BlackjackDuck's tile generator** generates grid panels, not accessories — use for geometry reference only.
>           - - **David D's Multiconnect Thread Docs PDF** is the ground truth for channel dimensions — download it first.
>             - - **MakerWorld parametric maker** workflow: Code button -> Cmd+A -> paste -> Save -> close -> Generate -> wait 15s -> inspect -> Download 3MF.
>             - - **Gravity is your enemy with drop-in designs** — a U-cradle with an open bottom faces the floor under a desk. The laptop falls straight out. Use slide-in C-channel rails so the laptop enters horizontally and gravity pushes it onto the lips, not out of the holder.

> ### Mount 1 — MacBook Air M2 🔄 REDESIGNED (slide-in v1)
> | Field | Value |
> |---|---|
> | Dimensions | 304.1 x 215.0 x 11.3 mm |
> | Mount type | **Slide-in C-channel rails** (2 identical rails, flipped for L/R) |
> | Orientation | Slides front-to-back horizontally; gravity holds laptop onto lips |
> | Channel height | 11.3 + 3 = 14.3mm (laptop + clearance) |
> | Snap count | ~12 (6 channels per rail × 2 rails) |
> | SCAD file | mba-m2-slide-rail.scad |
> | Status | v1 designed — ready to print |
> | Notes | Each rail is 38×180mm, fits flat on P2S. Print 2 copies, flip one. Space rails ~11 grid holes apart (308mm). |
> | Previous | mba-m2-cradle.scad (drop-in U-shape, retired — laptop fell out due to gravity) |

> | Mount type | Same U-shape as MBA |
> | Drop distance | 20.2 + 1 + 8 = 29.2mm |
> | Snap count | ~15 |
> | Notes | Back rail 313mm — likely needs splitting into 2 pieces for P2S |

> | Snap count | ~8 |
>
> ---
>
> ### Total Snap Count
> | Mount | Snaps |
> |---|---|
